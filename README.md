# Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier

## Objective
Learn to implement Decision Tree and Random Forest models for classification tasks using the Heart Disease dataset.

## Dataset
- **File:** 
- **Target Variable:** 
  - 0 = No Heart Disease
  - 1 = Heart Disease

## Tasks
1. Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it.
2. Analyze overfitting by limiting the tree depth.
3. Train a Random Forest and compare its accuracy.
4. Interpret feature importances using bar plots.
5. Evaluate models using 5-fold cross-validation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
